# Find_your_career_path
Choosing the right career is significant due to the diversified human abilities. Many students are choosing their career path without receiving proper advice from suitable professionals or university services. This may potentially cause a mismatch between the academic achievements, personality, interests, and abilities of the students. In order to recommend students in career selection, it is essential to build a system that provides direction and guidance to students in choosing their career. The key challenge in this project is selecting key attributes that help in predicting the right path to meet diversified studentsâ€™ goals. This Web application will be very useful for the students as an advisor in choosing their career course. 
The proposed framework for Find your Career Path is aimed at bridging the gap between students and career counselors. Here, we have developed a software tool to provide all the available degrees of different groups. This tool will help you determine and will eventually help you in choosing your own career path.
